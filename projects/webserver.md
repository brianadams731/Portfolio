A WebServer built from scratch, that implements a subset of HTTP 1.1. This WebServer provides functionality for the basic HTTP methods (GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE), Auth, CGI Scripting, Basic Caching, and Concurrency. This project was a great opportunity to develop a technical understanding of the HTTP spec, and web fundamentals.
