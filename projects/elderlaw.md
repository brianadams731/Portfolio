This is an application used to onboard new clients at a local law office, that is currently being used in production today. This is a complex form featuring 7 pages of various form elements, including 2 dynamic fields that expand to add more fields if needed. This application is animated with Framer Motion, which gives the progress bar and card animations a more polished and natural feel. This application leverages React Hook Forms which helps with form validation and dynamic elements. The onboarding application uses a Flask backend which parses the data collected into a shape the client desires, as well as notifies and serves the data to the attorney when a potential client submits the form.
