Thought Grove is a social study platform. Users create study decks which use a spaced repetition algorithm to help users learn more efficiently. These user created decks are then shared in a public marketplace where other users are free to vote on, comment on and subscribe to these decks. Users can also create groups which feature a public form where group members can discuss various topics. Groups also feature a bulletin board where group founders can organize events like group study sessions. This project is currently being worked on and close to being completed.
