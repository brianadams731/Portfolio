This is a blog that is currently being built for a wellness coach. This site will soon be a production site and used on a daily basis. The site is built on NextJS, and is statically generated. I choose to build with NextJS for the speed and security it offers, as well as the flexibility it offers so this site can grow as the client's needs grow. This blog uses Sanity for its CMS where all the blog data is authored by the client. The data will then automatically be fetched and parsed with GraphQL, which will build and deploy the site with the new static content. This site also offers the client flexibility to change the content of the site as they see fit, without developer intervention.
