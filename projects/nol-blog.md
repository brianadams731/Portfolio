This is a blog that is currently being built for a wellness coach. This site will soon be a production site and used on a daily basis. The site is built on NextJS, and is statically generated. I choose to build with NextJS for the great dx and ux, as well as the flexibility it offers so this site can grow as the client's needs grow. This blog uses Sanity for its CMS where all the blog data is authored by the client. After a posts is authored a webhook triggers a build process where the project is statically regenerated. This site also offers the client flexibility to change the content of the site as they see fit, without developer intervention.
