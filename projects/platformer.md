Inspired by retro games like Castlevania and Super Mario Bros, made using TypeScript and PixiJS. I decided not to use any game engines building this project, instead using this project as an opportunity to solve problems like tile maps, enemy logic and looping parallax with my own implementation. This project was a great opportunity to focus on my typescript fundamentals and organization of larger project structures.
