Inspired by retro games like Castlevania and Super Mario Bros, made using TypeScript and PixiJS. I decided against using a game engine when building this project. Instead I used this project as an opportunity to solve problems like tile maps, enemy logic and looping parallax with my own implementations. This project was a great opportunity to focus on my typescript fundamentals and organization of larger project structures.
